The repository consists of the different data science projects worked over the course of time.

1) spam classification project
-------------------------------
The project is undertaken for practicse on the nltk library and working with text.
For the project, I have used the kaggle spam sms classification data.
TfidfVectorizer
CounterVectorizer
Tokenization
Lemmatization
Stemming
Multinomial Naives Bayes

2) House Price Prediction- Kaggle dataset

The  linear regression model used for the prediction of house prices has an accuracy of 89.76%
and this turns out to be the highest accuracy achieved throughout the experiment. Random forest
model has also been tried (87.21%) however; the accuracy was significantly low compared to the linear 
regression model. Linear regression has been implemented initially without the exclusion of outliers 
from the train dataset and in the process of tuning to achieve greater accuracy; the outliers were 
detected and removed from the train dataset



During the preliminary examination, it has been observed that the train data consists of 1460 instances with 79 dependent variables, of these 
36 were numerical attributes of data type integer and float and 43 were categorical attributes.
